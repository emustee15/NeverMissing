# Never Missing
*Never Missing* is an Android application created with the idea of keeping track of stuff. I created it for my mobile applications class in Spring 2014. 

The app may help you keep track of lost things by keeping a database of previous locations you found lost objects.  Let's say you frequently misplace your wallet. Upon finding your wallet, you can use to save the location of your wallet with a picture and message of where you left it. Therefore, next time your wallet is missing, you can be sure you checked all the original locations.

This may all seem boring, however, Never Missing also supports large objects as well using GPS. The app features a compass that allows points one in the right direction to where they set the coordinate. Since it does not make sense to have small objects in your house tracked via GPS (of course due to error), the app classifies obejcts into two groups, large and small. Large objects (such as your car or buried treasure) get GPS coordinates, while your wallet or keys get a picture and description.
